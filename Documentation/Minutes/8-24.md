Final Project Outline

Inventory & Shipment Management Portal- Carlota Najera
 Purpose: Create a shared platform for vendors and engineering teams to track incoming shipments, packing slips, and inventory status in real time.

Core Deliverables

Security & Access
    - Password-protected links for external vendors
    - Audit logs for every upload, edit, and access event
    - Role-based access (client, engineer, manager)

Client Side:

Order Submission Portal
    - Upload order details, packing slips, and expected delivery dates
    - Auto-generate a tracking link and secure password for access

Engineering Team:

Pack Slip Repository
    - Centralized access to all packing slips with search and tagging
    - Link to specific engineering projects or deployment sites

Incoming Inventory Tracker
    - See whatâ€™s arriving, when, and from whom
    - Filter by project, vendor, or urgency

Stretch Deliverables

Client Side:

Shipment Status Dashboard
    - View delivery progress, carrier info, and estimated arrival
    - Attach documentation (e.g., MSDS sheets, manuals, certifications)

Engineering Team:

Low-Stock & Reorder Alerts
    - Set thresholds for critical components
    - Notify purchasing teams when stock dips below safe levels

Barcode Scanning & Tagging
    - Scan items on arrival to auto-log them into the system
    - Assign internal tags for location, usage, or team ownership

UI/UX first (figma)
